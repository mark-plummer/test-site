title: [Configure periodic backups]

last_updated: tbd toc: true sidebar: mydoc_sidebar permalink: /:collection/:path.html -- You can configure ThoughtSpot to backup automatically at specified times.
The policy allows you to control the type, frequency, retention periods (first-in-first-out), and output location for a periodic backup.

A periodic backup uses the same steps as creating a backup manually.
However, you do not have to specify a snapshot name, the system uses the most recent backup.
You can backup to a local file system or link:{{ site.baseurl }}/admin/setup/NAS-mount.html#[mount a NAS (network attached storage) file system] to hold the backup.
A NAS is recommended.
Make sure you have adequate space to store the number of backups you want to archive.

== Default policy format

The format for a policy includes the following:

----
name: "name_for_backup"
param {
    mode: FULL | DATALESS | LIGHTWEIGHT
    type: STANDALONE
}
schedule {
    period {
      number: integer
      unit: MINUTE | HOUR | DAY
    }
    retention_policy {
          time {
          number: integer
          unit:  MINUTE | HOUR | DAY
        }
        capacity: integer
      }
  }
  offset_minutes_from_sunday_midnight: integer
}
directory: "NAME"
storage_type: NAS | LOCAL
----

== Before you begin

Before creating a policy, make sure you have read link:how-to-create-a-schedule.html[Understand backup/snapshot schedules] for information on configuring a `schedule` element.
In addition, you must specify:

|===
| Element | Description

| `mode`
| The backup mode.
`FULL` backups are necessary for restoring a cluster.
See link:backup-modes.html[Work with backups] for details on each backup mode.

| `type`
| Currently, only `STANDALONE` is supported.

| `directory`
| The location on the disk to place the backup.

| `storage_type`
| The type of storage you are using.
`NAS` storage is recommended for `FULL` backups.
|===

== Create a backup policy

Backups cannot start when another backup is still running.
So, choose a reasonable frequency for the mode in you policy.
For example, a `FULL` backup takes longer than a `DATALESS` backup.
Consider the load on the system when configuring.
Do not backup up when the system would experience a heavy load.
For example, you may want to take `FULL` backups late in the evening or on weekends.

The retention system deletes the oldest stored backup and the corresponding snapshot on a first-in-first-out basis (FIFO).
This means that if you set a bucket retention of 1 the system stores a single backup at any one time.
The system  deletes the older backup after the new full backup is successful.

=== Configure using Management Console

{% include note.html content="The Management Console is now available in *beta* for customers with ThoughtSpot 5.3 or later.
Please contact ThoughtSpot Support, if you want to try it." %}

To configure periodic backups using the admin UI:

. Log into ThoughtSpot from a browser.
. Click the *Admin* menu on the top navigation bar.
+
image::{{ site.baseurl }}/images/admin.png[]
+
This opens the ThoughtSpot Management Console.

. Click *Settings* menu on the top navigation bar.
+
image::{{ site.baseurl }}/images/settings.png[]

. In the Settings panel, click *Backup Policy* and then *Configure* option.
+

. Click *Save* to update the backup policy.

=== Configure using tscli

To configure periodic backups using the tscli:

. Log in to the Linux shell using SSH.
. Find a directory with enough disk space to support the `retention_policy number` you configure.
+
You can use `df -h` to see free disk space and `tscli snapshot ls` to view existing snapshots and their size on disk.

. Use the `tscli backup-policy create` command.
+
The command opens a `vi` editor for you to configure the backup policy.

. Write and save the file to store your configuration.
+
By default, newly created policies are automatically enabled.
To disable a policy, use the `tscli backup-policy disable` command.

. Verify the policy using the `tscli backup periodic-config <name>` command.

=== Doing more with backup

The following table lists some additional backup commands you can use.

|===
| To | Command

| List present backup policies.
| `tscli backup-policy ls`

| Show a backup policy.
| `tscli backup-policy show <name>`

| Check the status of a policy.
| `tscli backup-policy status <name>`

| Change an existing policy.
| `tscli backup-policy update <name>`

| Disable or enable an existing policy.
| `tscli backup-policy disable` or `enable`

| Delete a policy
| `tscli backup-policy delete <name>`
|===

Finally, you can time a `crontab` job with your periodic backup configuration to move a backup to longer term storage.
Simply create a `crontab` job that moves the backup to a location outside of the `directory` defined in the periodic schedule.
