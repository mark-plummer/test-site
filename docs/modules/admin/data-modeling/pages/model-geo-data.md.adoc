Certain attribute columns that contain location data can be used to create GeoMaps.
ThoughtSpot supports Latitude, Longitude, Zip Code, US States, US Counties, Countries, and select international sub-nation regions.

You can designate a column as `Geo` by editing the *GEO CONFIG* column in the table *Columns* page.
You cannot edit the geo configuration column information in the `model.xls` file.

== Guidelines for geographic columns

Columns that can be designated as `Geo` columns need to contain text (`VARCHAR`) data unless they contain latitude/longitude data.
Latitude and longitude columns can contain numeric data (`DOUBLE`) or text.

If you are using a column with the data type `DOUBLE` for latitude and longitude, you will also need to change the following settings for those columns:

* set *Column Type* to `ATTRIBUTE`
* set *Additive* to `NO`
* set *Aggregation Type* to `NONE`

For information these settings, see link:change-aggreg-additive.html[Set ADDITIVE or AGGREGATION].

== How to edit geographic columns

. Find the *GEO CONFIG* for the column that contains the geographical data.
. Select the column to display the *Specify Geographic Configuration* dialog.

. Change the value to the appropriate *GEO CONFIG*, depending on the kind of geo data the column contains.
+
If your data includes latitude and/or longitude columns that are stored as a  numeric data type (`DOUBLE`), make these changes for those columns:

 .. Change the *Type* to `ATTRIBUTE`.
 .. Change *ADDITIVE* to `NO`/`FALSE`.

. Save your changes.
