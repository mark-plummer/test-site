toc: true summary: "Use the schema viewer to see tables and worksheets and their relationships.
" sidebar: mydoc_sidebar permalink: /:collection/:path.html -- ThoughtSpot has a ##Schema Viewer** though which you can examine the database schema.
It is interactive and configurable, so you can see the level of detail that is relevant to your work.

You must have *Admin* privileges to use the *Schema Viewer*.

== Why use the Schema Viewer

You can use the Schema Viewer to discover the following information:

* What is the relationship between two tables?
* What tables make up this worksheet, and how are they joined?

The schema viewer shows joins between tables, join directionality, and join type.

()
(whether they are Foreign Key to Primary Key, relationship joins, or joins
defined by users through the web interface). Use the **Table** list to find a
specific table or worksheet.

== How the Schema Viewer shows joins

You can use the Schema Viewer to review your schema and ensure that it was modeled using best practices.
For example, joins appear in different colors to distinquish their type:

* Red is used for generic relationships
* Green is used for primary key/foreign key joins

When viewing a worksheet, you can also see what joins connect the tables: the inner, left outer, right outer, or full outer joins

A good rule to follow is "Keep it Green".
This means that you can get better results from PK/FK joins rather than from using generic relationships.
You should only use generic relationships when the tables being joined have a many-to-many rather than a PK/FK structure.
If you find tables that have been joined using a generic relationship, but could have used a PK/FK join, you should drop the relationship and create a PK/FK join instead.
To do this, you need to use the ALTER TABLE...DROP RELATIONSHIP statement in TQL.
Then use ALTER TABLE...ADD FOREIGN KEY to create the PK/FK join.

== Worksheet view

Worksheets are often based on more than one table.
The worksheet schema will show schemas for the tables behind the worksheet, as well as the joins between tables _that were created as a part of the worksheet_.

Click a worksheet, to see it in the Schema Viewer.
If the schema view is not showing the schema behind the worksheet, double click the tab on the top right of the worksheet object.

The worksheet view shows the following information:

* All tables in the worksheet, and the relationships between these tables.
* Source columns for all columns of a worksheet.
* Keys and definitions for each relationship, as well as join paths and types.
* Columns that are derived from formulas.
* Correct join paths for newly created chasm trap worksheets.
Chasm trap worksheets created prior to ThoughtSpot version 4.4 do not show the correct join paths.
