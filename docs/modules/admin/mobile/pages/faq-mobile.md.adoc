title: [Mobile FAQ]

last_updated: tbd sidebar: mydoc_sidebar permalink: /:collection/:path.html -- *Q*: Where are the cached data and login credentials stored on the mobile device?
+ *A*: ThoughtSpot iOS app stores two kinds of data:

* Authentication data: stored in an encrypted database called a keychain.
For more information, refer to Apple's documentation on https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/keychain_services[Keychain Services]
* Cached data for the home pinboard: saved as encrypted files on iOS.
iOS handles the encryption and decryption of these files behind the scenes.
We use the '`default' protection level which means the files are inaccessible until the first time the user unlocks the device.
For more information, refer to Apple's documentation on https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/protecting_the_user_s_privacy/encrypting_your_app_s_files[Encrypting your App's Files]

{% include note.html content="Data saved by the ThoughtSpot mobile app cannot be accessed from any other app." %}

From Apple's documentation on https://www.apple.com/business/site/docs/iOS_Security_Guide.pdf[iOS Security]:    "All third-party apps are "`sandboxed,`" so they are restricted from accessing files stored by other apps or from making changes to the device.
This prevents apps from gathering or modifying information stored by other apps."

*Q*: Can I delete the mobile device's data and stop functionality like copy/paste or screenshots?
+ *A*: Yes.
You get these features if you deploy the app using management platforms like Airwatch, Mobile Iron, Microsoft Intune, etc.

*Q*: Can I restrict the apps showing up on the share sheet?
+ *A*: Yes.
Currently Facebook, Twitter and Weibo are removed from the share sheet.

*Q*: Which types of app data are being cached on the device?
+ *A*: The app only caches the Home page data.
