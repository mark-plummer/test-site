:summary: This guide covers all topics of special interest to application administrators.

This guide provides information for application administrators, or users with link:{{ site.baseurl }}/admin/setup/logins.html[administrative access privileges].

Before addressing the major components of this guide, we recommend that you familiarize yourself with the general top-level link:{{ site.baseurl }}/admin/architecture/components.html[architecture] of the ThoughtSpot service.

Administrators are responsible for many facets of the ThoughtSpot service.
They are most frequently in charge of these common processes:
