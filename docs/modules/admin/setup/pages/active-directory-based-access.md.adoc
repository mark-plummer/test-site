== Enable Active Directory based access on a ThoughtSpot node

ThoughtSpot supports enabling Active Directory (AD) based access individually on each node where the commands are run.
There is no provision to enable AD access for the whole cluster with a single command.
To enable AD access on a cluster, you need to run these commands on each individual node and on any additional nodes added to the cluster.

The command to enable system AD user access is:

----
tscli sssd enable --user <USER> --domain <DOMAIN>
----

You will then be prompted for password credentials.

{% include note.html content="The user must have permission to join a computer or VM to the domain."%}

== Set sudoers AD Group on a local node

Just like enabling AD based access on a node, setting `sudo` AD group applies only on the node where the command is run, and is not set for the whole cluster.

The command to allow `sudo` permissions for AD group:

----
tscli sssd set-sudo-group <ACTIVE_DIRECTORY_GROUP_NAME>
----

== Clear sudoers AD Group on a local node

Clearing `sudo` AD group only applies on the node where command is run, and is not set for the whole cluster.

The command to clear `sudo` permissions for the AD group:

----
tscli sssd clear-sudo-group <ACTIVE_DIRECTORY_GROUP_NAME>
----

== Disable AD based access on a local node

Currently ThoughtSpot supports disabling AD based access individually on each node where the commands are run.
There is no provision to disable AD access for the whole cluster with a single command.
To disable AD access on a cluster,  run these commands on each individual node and any additional nodes added to the cluster.

Command to disable system AD user access is:

----
tscli sssd disable
----

{% include note.html content="Running this command will also remove the AD group from sudoers list."%}
