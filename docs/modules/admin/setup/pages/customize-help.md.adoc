last_updated: tbd summary: "You customize ThoughtSpot Help to be specific to your data, examples, and documentation." sidebar: mydoc_sidebar permalink: /:collection/:path.html -- You can customize the Help for your ThoughtSpot application to tailor it to your organization.
Configuring these Help settings sets system-wide defaults for all your users.

When your ThoughtSpot users click the Help icon, they see a list of links.

As an administrator, you can add your own links to this list.
This allows you to include documentation specific to your company, such as information about the data available in ThoughtSpot, where to get support internally, or company-specific training.

You can also edit existing links, change icons, or remove items from the help listing altogether.
