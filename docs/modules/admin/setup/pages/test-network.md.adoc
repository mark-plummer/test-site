title: [Test network connectivity between nodes]

last_updated: tbd summary: "Verify your network is properly configured for the application." sidebar: mydoc_sidebar permalink: /:collection/:path.html -- This procedure tests the network connectivity between all ThoughtSpot nodes, and to the LAN.
If you can perform these steps successfully, the network settings on ThoughtSpot are correct.

. Log in to the Linux shell using SSH.
. Ping each of the other nodes in the cluster.
. Ping another machine that exists outside of the cluster, for example, a machine that you will use to stage data to be loaded.

If you cannot perform these tests successfully, there is a problem with the network setup.
If the tests fail, check link:{{ site.baseurl }}/admin/troubleshooting/check-connectivity.html#[Network connectivity issues].
