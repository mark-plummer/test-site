title: [Check the timezone]

sidebar: mydoc_sidebar permalink: /:collection/:path.html -- ThoughtSpot comes configured with the timezone where it is to be installed.
Data is imported based on the timezone of the node from which `tsload` or `tql` is run.
To see the timezone your ThoughtSpot node is running under, log into the server as the `thoughtspot` user and run the `date` command:

----
[thoughtspot@ts.server etc]$ date
Tue Feb 20 09:07:04 PST 2018
----

To see the current timezone used by the ThoughtSpot application, choose menu:Admin[Cluster Manager] and review the *Cluster Details*:

image::{{ site.baseurl }}/images/app-timezone.png[]

The timezones should match.

Sometimes the timezone that is listed by `date` is not the active timezone for the ThoughtSpot application and the application needs to be reset.
If you need to change the timezone, link:{{ site.baseurl }}/admin/misc/contact.html#[contact ThoughtSpot Support] and they will change the timezone for you.
You may need to change the timezone if you move the server between data centers.
