title: [Create a formula in a worksheet]

last_updated: tbd summary: "You can define formulas and use them to create derived columns in worksheets.
" sidebar: mydoc_sidebar permalink: /:collection/:path.html -- You create formulas by combining standard functions and operators, column names, and constant values.

Anyone who can create a worksheet can add a formula to it.
Formulas are not reusable;
the formula you create is associated only with the worksheet it belongs to.
A complete list of available formulas and examples of each is available in the link:{{ site.baseurl }}/reference/formula-reference.html#[Formula function reference].

You can create a formula in a worksheet by using the Formula Builder.
When you do this, the result of the formula gets added to the worksheet as a column.
Use these steps to create a formula:

. Create a new worksheet, or edit an existing one.
. Click the *+* button next to *Formulas*.
