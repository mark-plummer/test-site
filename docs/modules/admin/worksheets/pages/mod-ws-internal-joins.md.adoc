:summary: Learn how to change the join type between the tables within a worksheet
:toc: true

When you create a worksheet, you select a link:{{ site.baseurl }}/admin/worksheets/progressive-joins.html[join rule].
The join rule works together with the joins defined within the worksheet determine how the tables that make up the worksheet are joined, and how those joins behave when searching on the worksheet.

Starting with ThoughtSpot version 5.0, you are not limited to just one join rule for the entire worksheet.
You can define different types of joins for each join between tables in a worksheet.
Be default, each of these individual table joins uses an inner join.
But you can override this at the individual join level.

You must have either the *Can administer ThoughtSpot* privilege or the *Can manage data* privilege to modify joins within worksheets.
