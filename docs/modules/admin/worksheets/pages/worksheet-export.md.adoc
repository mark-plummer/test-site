:summary: You can export an entire ThoughtSpot worksheet in a flat-file format. After optional modification, you can migrate it to a different cluster, or restore it to the same cluster.

In ThoughtSpot, you can download Worksheets to a flat file in `yaml` format, modify the file, and subsequently upload this file either to the same cluster, or to a different cluster.
This mechanism supports several scenarios that you may encounter:

* *Migrating from a development environment to a production environment* by downloading the file from the development cluster and uploading the same file into the production cluster
* *Implementing metadata changes outside ThoughtSpot UI*, such as replacing the underlying tables for the entire table, or replacing a single column from one table with a column in another table
* *Making bulk changes*, such as mass renaming of objects defined by the worksheets, and managing duplicates
