:summary: After you determine your configuration options, you must set up your virtual machines using a ThoughtSpot image for Azure.

== About the ThoughtSpot image

To provision ThoughtSpot in the Azure portal, access the ThoughtSpot Virtual Machine in the Azure Marketplace.

The ThoughtSpot Virtual Machine comes provisioned with the custom ThoughtSpot image to make hosting simple.
A virtual machine is a preconfigured template that provides the information required to launch an instance of ThoughtSpot.
It includes the following:

* A template for the root volume for the instance (for example, an operating system, an appliance server, and applications).

The ThoughtSpot Virtual Machine has the ThoughtSpot software installed and configured, on a CentOS base image.
Check with your ThoughtSpot contact to learn about the latest version of the ThoughtSpot Virtual Machine.

Due to security restrictions, the ThoughtSpot Virtual Machine does not have default passwords for the administrator users.
When you are ready to obtain the password, contact link:{{ site.baseurl }}/appliance/contact.html[ThoughtSpot Support].

== Set up ThoughtSpot in Azure

Follow these steps to provision and set up the VMs and launch ThoughtSpot.

=== Prerequisites

Complete these steps before launching your ThoughtSpot Virtual Machine:

. Obtain an Azure login account.
. Set up usage payment details with Microsoft Azure.
. Set up a link:{{ site.baseurl }}#create-instance[Resource Group].

[#create-instance]
=== Create an instance

Create a resource group and a resource based on the https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/thoughtspot-inc.thoughtspotvirtualmachine[ThoughtSpot Virtual Machine] on the https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/[Azure Marketplace].

. Log into the Azure portal.

=== Configure basic settings

. Provide a username for your new virtual machine.
. Select either *SSH public key* or *Password*.
 ** If you select *Password*, supply a password and confirm it by typing it again.
 ** If you select *SSH public key*, contact link:{{ site.baseurl }}/appliance/contact.html[ThoughtSpot Support] for a key.
. Choose a disk type.
+
{% include tip.html content=" The new Standard SSD disk types are only available for particular regions.
Make sure this disk type is supported in the region you chose for your VM before selecting it." %}
+
See https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/preview-standard-ssd-disks-for-azure-virtual-machine-workloads/[Standard SSD Disks for Virtual Machine workloads] for more on SSD disks.
ThoughtSpot recommends the Premium SSD disks.

. Provide a Resource Group, by clicking `existing` and selecting the one you just created.

=== Configure network settings, storage, and other options

_Prerequisite_: Get the details needed for setting up the Virtual Network, Subnet, and Network Security Group from your Azure support team.

. For storage, select *Yes* to *use managed disks*.
. Under *Network*, select *Virtual network*, then *Subnet*, then *Public IP addresses*, and set those names, addresses, and ranges approriately for your network.
. Open the necessary Inbound and Outbound ports to ensure that the ThoughtSpot processes do not get blocked.
+
The minimum ports needed are:
+
|===
| Port | Protocol | Service

| 22
| SSH
| Secure Shell access

| 80
| HTTP
| Web access

| 443
| HTTPS
| Secure Web access

| 12345
| TCP
| ODBC and JDBC drivers access

| 2201
| HTTP
| Cluster Debugging

| 2101
| HTTP
| Node daemon Debugging

| 4001
| HTTP
| Data Cache Debugging
|===
+
{% include note.html content="Nodes purchased from Azure must be reachable to each other so that they can communicate and form a distributed environment.
ThoughtSpot requires that these ports be accessible between nodes within a cluster.
Use your discretion about whether to restrict public access or not for all nodes and all ports." %}
+
Refer to link:{{ site.baseurl }}/appliance/firewall-ports.html[network policies] for more information.

. Configure `auto shutdown`, `monitoring`, `guest OS diagnostics`, and any other settings to your preference.
If you have no preference, you can leave them on their default settings.
+
image::{{ site.baseurl }}/images/azure_network_settings.png[]

. Click *OK*.
+
Azure will do the final validation check.

=== Review the Summary

Verify that the validation check succeeded and that summary of information shown is correct.
If you find errors, reconfigure as needed.

When you are satisfied with the virtual machine setup, click *Create*.

=== Prepare for starting up ThoughtSpot

_Prerequisite_: To log into the VM, you need the private key that is available in the image.
You can obtain this from your ThoughtSpot contact.

. Obtain the VM's public and private IP addresses.
 ** To see the public IP, click the VM name link.
This will show the public IP of the VM.
 ** To see the private IP click Networking (under SETTINGS on the left side of the screen).
. In a terminal application, connect to the VM through SSH.
Use the private key provided for the admin user.
 ** You must file a support ticket to obtain this private key;
it is necessary for the first login.
 ** This key is different from the credentials, or the private keys supplied in earlier steps, which do not work in this context.

 $ ssh admin@<VM-IP>
. Update the password for both the `admin` and the `thoughtspot` users.
+   The command prompts you to type in a new password, and then to confirm the password.

 $ sudo passwd admin
 Changing password for user admin
 $ sudo passwd thoughtspot
 Changing password for user thoughtspot
+
{% include warning.html content="If you do not change the password, you cannot log back into your Azure VMs.
Your private key does not work after initial installation." %}

. Update the file `/etc/hosts` with all the node IP addresses for the other VMs that will be part of the ThoughtSpot cluster.

=== Add Storage Disks

. Go back to the VM and click it.
. Add 2 SSD disks of 1TB each.
. Click *Add data disk* and choose *Create disk from the menu*.
. Create one mode data disk (demo-disk2) and save them both.
. Click *Save* to add the disks to the VM.
. Verify that the disks were added by issuing `lsblk` in your terminal application:

 $ lsblk
+
Your result may look something like the following:
+
----
NAME    MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
fd0       2:0    1    4K  0 disk
sda       8:0    0  200G  0 disk
├─sda1    8:1    0    1G  0 part /mntboot
├─sda2    8:2    0   20G  0 part /
├─sda3    8:3    0   20G  0 part /update
└─sda4    8:4    0  159G  0 part /export
sdb       8:16   0    1T  0 disk
└─sb1     8:17   0    1T  0 part /mnt/resource
sdc       8:32   0    1T  0 disk
sdd       8:48   0    1T  0 disk
sr0      11:0    1  628K  0 rom
----

. Unmount the temporary disk by issuing the following command:

 $ sudo umount /mnt/resource

. Prepare the disks /dev/sdc and /dev/sdd for ThoughtSpot by issuing the following command:

{% include warning.html content="Do not use the disk `/dev/sdb`.
This disk is reserved for ThoughtSpot use." %}

----
   $ sudo /usr/local/scaligent/bin/prepare_disks.sh /dev/sdc /dev/sdd
----

. Check the disks' status by issuing the following command:

 $ df -h

. Repeat the steps in this section for each node in your cluster.

=== Create network support settings

{% include tip.html content="All changes in this section must be re-applied each time after a cluster is created or updated.
If these changes are not present, a reboot of the VMs will not have network access.
So when updating these files, keep a backup to copy after any subsequent cluster creation or update." %}

. SSH into one of your VMs.
+
----
 ssh admin@<VM-IP>
----

. Update the VM's hostname:

 $ sudo hostnamectl set-hostname <HOSTNAME>
+
If you are using a static name, you can issue:
+
----
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname <HOSTNAME> --static
----

. Update `/etc/hosts` with the IP and hostname:
+
[source,console]
----
$ sudo vi /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0

DEVICE=eth0 ONBOOT=yes BOOTPROTO=dhcp HWADDR=<Add eth0 MAC> TYPE=Ethernet USERCTL=no PEERDNS=yes IPV6INIT=no
----

. Repeat this process for each node.
. Do not reboot any of the nodes, until these changes are made to each node:
+
a.
Open the grub file  /update/etc/default/grub in an editor:
+
----
   $ sudo vi /update/etc/default/grub
----
+
b.
Change the line:
+
----
   GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="console=tty0 console=ttyS1,115200n8"
----
+
to:
+
----
   GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="console=tty0 console=ttyS1,115200n8 net.ifnames=0"
----
+
c.
Save your changes.

. Issue these commands:

 $ sudo cp /update/etc/default/grub /etc/default/
 $ rm /usr/local/scaligent/bin/setup-net-devices.sh

. Reboot the nodes.
