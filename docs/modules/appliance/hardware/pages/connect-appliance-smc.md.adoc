:summary: Connect the SMC appliance before you can deploy ThoughtSpot.

After you rack and stack the appliance, it is time to configure it.
If necessary, review the link:{{ site.baseurl }}/appliance/hardware/inthebox.html[Hardware Appliance Overview].
Follow the steps in this checklist.

[#appliance-step-1]
== Step 1: Connect switches to 10GbE ports

Connect the 10GbE port of each node, as illustrated in link:{{ site.baseurl }}/appliance/hardware/connect-appliance-smc.html#haswell-port-location[Haswell port location] and link:{{ site.baseurl }}/appliance/hardware/connect-appliance-smc.html#skylake-port-location[Skylake port location], to the 10GbE switches on your own rack, using either fiber or DAC cables.

Refer to the link:{{ site.baseurl }}/appliance/hardware/cable-reference.html[Cable reference] for information on the cable types:

* link:{{ site.baseurl }}/appliance/hardware/cable-reference.html#fiber-cables[Fiber Cables]
* link:{{ site.baseurl }}/appliance/hardware/cable-reference.html#dac-cables[DAC Cables]

{% include note.html content="Ask your hardware vendor for more details about what they supply and what you need to buy." %}

Depending on which version of the SMC appliance you have, Haswell or Skylake, your 10GbE ports are in a different spot on the back of the appliance.
Here is a picture of the back of each appliance.

{% include image.html file="smc-appliance-skylake-location-ports.png" title="Skylake port location" alt="The data and management ports are on the back of the SMC Skylake appliance." caption="Skylake port location" %}

* Connect to switches *only* the appliances (4 nodes each) that you plan to use in the cluster.
* You must power off, or disconnect from the switch, all other appliances or nodes.
+ This prevents accidental configuration of incorrect nodes.
* You must connect all nodes, even if using only one node, to a 10G switch.
* Verify that the connection is valid by pinging the gateway: + Enter `ping <default-gateway-IP>`.
+ Ask your network administrator for your default gateway IP if you have not already listed it in your ThoughtSpot site survey.
+

  $ ping <default-gateway-IP>

[#appliance-step-2]
== Step 2: Connect IPMI ports

Connect the IPMI port of each node to the management switch.
+ See link:{{ site.baseurl }}/appliance/hardware/connect-appliance-smc.html#haswell-port-location[Haswell port location] and link:{{ site.baseurl }}/appliance/hardware/connect-appliance-smc.html#skylake-port-location[Skylake port location].

[#appliance-step-3]
== Step 3: Turn on nodes

Turn on the power to the nodes by pressing the power button;
see link:{{ site.baseurl }}/appliance/hardware/connect-appliance-smc.html#smc-appliance-power-button[Appliance Power Button].

There is one power button for each node.

[#appliance-step-4]
== Step 4: Log in

. Connect a keyboard and the mouse to each node on the appliance.
. You should see a login prompt on the screen.
If you don't see one or the screen isn't responsive, press the key combination *control--alt--F2* on your keyboard to bring up the login prompt.
. Log in using the admin user credentials for the console.
If you do not know the admin credentials, ask your network administrator.
