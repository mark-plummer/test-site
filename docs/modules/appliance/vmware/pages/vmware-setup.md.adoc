:summary: Learn how to install a ThoughtSpot cluster in a VMware environment.

This page explains how to install a ThoughtSpot cluster in a VMware VSphere Hypervisor (ESXi) 6.5 environment.
For each hardware node, you must:

* Complete the prerequisites
* Use the ThoughtSpot Open Virtualization Format (OVF) file to create a virtual machine (VM)
* Add hard disks to the VM

== Prerequisites

This installation process assumes you have already acquired your host machines.
You can install on a cluster with any number of nodes.
A one node cluster is suitable for a sandbox environment but is insufficient for a production environment.
You need at least three nodes for high availability (HA), but there is no limit on the number of nodes.

. Make sure you have installed the Hypervisor on each of your nodes.
+
The VM template, by default, captures a 72-core configuration.
If your physical host has more than 72 cores, you may want to edit VM to have (`n-2`) cores (for a physical host with n cores) to fully take advantage of computing power of the physical host.
Extra cores help performance.
+
You should aim to allocate 490 GB or more RAM.

. Create datastores for all solid-state drive (SSD) and hard drive devices.

== Use the OVF to Create a VM

. *https://thoughtspot.egnyte.com/dl/iWvEqo76Pr/[Download]* the `ThoughtSpot OVF` to a location on an accessible disk.
. Log into the ESXi web portal.
+

. Select menu:Virtual Machines[Create/Register VM].
+
The system displays the dialog for selecting an OVF template.
+

. Choose the OVF template and click *Next*.
+
The system prompts you to select a storage.

. Choose the SSD as the destination and click *Next*.
+
The system displays the *Deployment Options* dialog.

. Enter the options and click *Next*.

. Wait for the template to be loaded.
+
Depending on your network speed, loading can take several minutes.

. Make sure that VM is powered off.

== Add hard disks to the VM

|===
| Use Case | HDFS Disk Requirements

| POC
| 2 x 1 TB on HDD

| Production
| 3 x 2 TB on HDD
|===

For a proof of concept (POC), follow these steps to create two 1TB HDFS disks on HDD storage, as shown here (2 x 1TB).

For production deployments, ThoughtSpot requires you to have three 2TB HDFS disks on HDD (3 x 2TB).
For this use case, follow these same steps to create the additional, larger capacity disks.

. Edit the VM you just created.
+
image::{{ site.baseurl }}/images/vmware-add-disk0.png[]

. Select menu:Add hard disk[New hard disk].
+
image::{{ site.baseurl }}/images/vmware-adddisk1.png[]
+
The new disk appears as a new row under the only existing SSD row.

. Click the *New Hard disk* to expand the detailed configuration options.
. For a proof of concept, set the options as follows.
(For production deployments, set the size to 2TB.)+++<table>++++++<colgroup>++++++<col width="50%">++++++</col>+++

 +++<tr>++++++<th>+++Thin provisioned+++</th>+++
  +++<td>+++Check this box.+++</td>++++++</tr>++++++</table>+++
+
You should see something similar to the following:
+
image::{{ site.baseurl }}/images/vmware-adddisk2-1TB.png[]
. Save your changes.
. Repeat steps 1-5 to create more hard disks.
. Power on the VM
. After the VM is online, run the following command to prepare the HDFS disks:
+
[source,shell]
----
 sudo /usr/local/scaligent/bin/prepare_disks.sh
----

== Next steps

There is no network at this point on your VMs.
As a prerequisite:

. Verify that Network Adapter type is set to VMware vmxnet3 (Recommended).
. Verify that all ESXi hosts in your VMware farm for ThoughtSpot have been trunked to the VLAN assigned to your ThoughtSpot VMs.
. Verify that the console of all ThoughtSpot VMs is accessible in VMware vCenter Server.

After you finish, go to the http://support.thoughtspot.com[ThoughtSpot Support website] and use the support ticket for installation tasks.
If necessary, create a new ticket.
