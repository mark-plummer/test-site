title: [Search using growth over time]

last_updated: tbd summary: "You can show growth over time by using the growth of keyword in your search.
" sidebar: mydoc_sidebar permalink: /:collection/:path.html -- The `growth of` keyword compares the data from different date periods, and returns a percentage of growth.

== Growth of measure by year

To search using growth over time:

. Type `growth of` into the search bar, and choose a measure you're interested in seeing the growth of.

+
You will see a list of suggestions to choose from based on your sources.
You  can also type a different column name containing numeric data to compare.

. Type `by`, followed by a date column name.
+
The growth is calculated as a positive or negative percentage, for each  period relative to the last period in the series.
A line chart is a good  way to display your data, but the waterfall chart is especially effective  to show growth.

. You can also do year-over-year analysis, which compares each time period to the corresponding time period in the prior year.
+
This type of growth analysis is more common in retail and other seasonal  businesses.
To do this, type monthly year-over-year after your growth of phrase  in the search bar.
+

+
This compares data between the same month from different years.
For example,  it will allow you to compare sales from June of this year to the sales from  June of last year.
Note that for the first year, values are labeled as  "\{Blank}" in the Data View since there are no previous data to compare  them to.
+
Add an attribute to your search see the breakdown of how each grouping of  the attribute contributed to the overall growth of your measure.

. Click *Configure Chart* and add your attribute to the Legend field.
