This guide explains how to integrate ThoughtSpot with other data sources for loading data.
It also includes information on installing and using the ThoughtSpot clients (ODBC, JDBC, and more).

== ThoughtSpot Clients

ThoughtSpot provides certified clients to help you load data easily from your ETL tool or another database.
These include ODBC and JDBC drivers.

You can obtain the ThoughtSpot client downloads from the Help Center.
Always use the version of the ThoughtSpot clients that corresponds with the version of ThoughtSpot that you are running.
When upgrading, make sure to upgrade your clients as well.

{% include important.html content="The ETL tool must add a data transformation step if the source column data type does not exactly match the target's, ThoughtSpot's, column data type.
The driver does not do any implicit conversions." %}

== Methods for loading data

There are several ways to load data into ThoughtSpot, depending on your goals and where the data is located.
Always consider your requirements for recurring loads when planning how best to bring the data into ThoughtSpot.

Here are the options, with information on where to find the documentation for each method:+++<table>++++++<colgroup>++++++<col style="width:30%">++++++</col>+++

      +++<td>+++ThoughtSpot Loader is a command line tool to load CSV files into an existing database schema in ThoughtSpot. This is the fastest way to load extremely large amounts of data, and it can be run in parallel. You can also use this method to script recurring loads.
