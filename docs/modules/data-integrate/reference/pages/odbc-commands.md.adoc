title: [Supported SQL commands]

summary: "The ThoughtSpot connection drivers support a limited set of SQL commands." sidebar: mydoc_sidebar permalink: /:collection/:path.html -- The ODBC and JDBC drivers support a limited set of SQL commands.
When developing software that uses a ThoughtSpot ODBC driver, use this reference of supported commands.
This reference is intended for developers using other tools (ETL, etc.) to connect to ThoughtSpot through the ODBC or JDBC driver.

{% include note.html content="ThoughtSpot displays `VARCHAR` fields using lower case, regardless of what the original casing of your loaded data is." %}

== ODBC

These SQL commands are supported for ODBC:

* `CREATE TABLE`
+
Creates a table with the specified column definitions and constraints.
The table is replicated on each node.
+
----
  CREATE TABLE country_dim (id_number int, country varchar, CONSTRAINT PRIMARY KEY (id_number));
----

* `INSERT`
+
Creates placeholders in the table to receive the data.
+
----
  INSERT INTO TABLE country_dim (?, ?);
----

* `DELETE FROM <table>`
+
Deletes `ALL` rows from the specified table.
Use the `WHERE` clause to specify only certain rows to be deleted.
Example: You could remove all data for sales before a certain date to free up space in ThoughtSpot.
+
----
  DELETE FROM country_dim;
----

* `SELECT <cols_or_expression> FROM <table_list> [WHERE <predicates>] [GROUP BY <expressions>]``[ORDER BY <expressions>]`
+
Fetches the specified set of table data.
+
----
  SELECT id_number, country FROM country_dim WHERE id_number > 200;
----

== JDBC

`TRUNCATE` is not supported.
Instead, use `DELETE FROM TABLE` which is functionally equivalent to "`truncate table`" in terms of table compression and so forth.
