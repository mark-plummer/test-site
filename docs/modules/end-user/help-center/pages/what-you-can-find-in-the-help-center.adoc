:summary: There are many locations on the web where you can find help for ThoughtSpot.

There are multiple locations inside and outside the ThoughtSpot application where you can get more help.
This page describes some of the ways to get more help inside or outside of the application interface.

Each version of ThoughtSpot has its own documentation set.
ThoughtSpot releases new documentation sets for every major release version (`x.y`) of ThoughtSpot.
Documentation features added with minor versions (`x.y.z`) are added to the corresponding major release.
This means, for example, that new documentation for 4.4.1 minor release version appears in the 4.4 major version documentation.

{% include tip.html content="ThoughtSpot supplies release notes for every major release and every minor release version (`x.y.z`).

== Help menu

You can navigate directly to this site on the web by entering https://docs.thoughtspot.com[docs.thoughtSpot.com] in your browser's address bar.
You can see the documentation for the latest version of the product.

You can navigate to this documentation from inside the ThoughtSpot application as well.
In this case, the application links directly to the documentation version that matches your product version.
