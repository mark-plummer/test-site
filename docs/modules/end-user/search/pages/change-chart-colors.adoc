title: [Change chart colors]

last_updated: tbd summary: "You can change the colors used in a chart." sidebar: mydoc_sidebar permalink: /:collection/:path.html -- To change the colors used in a chart, use the color picker on the chart styles panel.
You can set colors for:

* bars, lines, areas, bubbles, maps, and other visuals on charts
* legends on charts
* tables for conditional formatting
* tags and editing the colors

To change the chart colors, you need at least one column in the chart's legend.
If the chart does not have a legend (not all do) and it is a single-measure chart, you can link:{{site.baseurl}}/end-user/search/apply-conditional-formatting.html[apply a conditional format] to change the color.
This type of conditional formatting does not work with Line charts.

Colors are maintained across searches within a session.
For example, when doing a search on revenue by state, each state will keep its color assigned to it even if you change the search or chart type.
