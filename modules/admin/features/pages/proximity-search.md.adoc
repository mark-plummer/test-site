title: [Proximity searches "near" and "farther than"]

last_updated: tbd summary: "If your table contains Latitude and Longitude data, you can use proximity searches that find entities related to each other by location." toc: false sidebar: mydoc_sidebar permalink: /:collection/:path.html -- Proximity keywords allow you to search and show the results on a map.
Using proximity keywords causes ThoughtSpot to display a circle that represents your set distance on the geo charts.

The proximity keywords are:

* `near`
* {blank}
+
[cols=3*]
|===
| `nearâ€¦within n miles`
| `km`
| `meters`
|===

* {blank}
+
[cols=3*]
|===
| `farther than n miles`
| `km`
| `meters from`
|===

The distance is calculated as a straight-line distance (not road distance) radius using miles, kilometers, or meters from the central point.
If you do not specify a distance, the system uses 10 km as the default.

Given a latitude, a longitude, and an optional distance, the search returns all instances of a geotype column that falls within the parameters.
These keywords are limited to 33 latitude/longitude pairs.
They work on duplicate counties.
Finally, you can filter on them.
Some examples of valid searches are:

`landings` _`latitude longitude city`_ `near tokyo`

`landings` _`latitude longitude city`_ `near tokyo within 50 miles`

You can bracket your search only with actual values found in the data.
So  "longitude between `-125.000000` and `-115.316670` worked for me, but not  `longitude between -125 and -115`.

=== Proximity search configuration requirements

All your data must be in the same set.
The worksheet or one of the tables must contain a column of type `longitude` and a column of type `latitude`.
The latitude and longitude data have to be on the same base tables for the feature to work.
You can't, for instance, have a dimension table with all your cities and their associated geo coordinates and join to it from your fact table and expect proximity search to work.

Also, your administrators must have configured these columns using the appropriate GeoType.
