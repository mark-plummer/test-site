title: [Materialize a view]

last_updated: 11/2/2018 summary: "Learn how to materialize a view to improve its performance." toc: false sidebar: mydoc_sidebar permalink: /:collection/:path.html --

To improve the performance of a view, you can materialize it.
This operation computes the data for the view and stores it in memory, just like a table.
You can expect a 3-6 times performance improvement on a materialized view over a view that is not materialized.
However, materialized views take up space in memory, so weigh the tradeoffs and benefits of materializing a view ahead of time.

{% include note.html content="Row Level Security does not apply to materialized views.
All users will see the same data when using the materialized view as a data source." %}

To materialize a view:

. To find your view, click *Data* in the top menu, and choose *Views*.
. Click the name of your view.
. Click *Schema*.
. If needed, link:{{ site.baseurl }}/admin/data-modeling/create-new-relationship.html[add joins].
. Under *Materialization*, click *Materialize*.

{% include note.html content="If you do not fill in the sharding details, the view will be replicated on every node of your cluster.
If you're not sure what to fill in, ask your ThoughtSpot administrator, or follow the links in this step to learn more about sharding." %}

. Click *Materialize*.
. In the *Schedule data updates* dialog, select an option for *Repeats* (Monthly, Weekly, or Daily).

. Fill in the schedule details:

If after some time, the status has not changed to *Materialized*, check the link:{{ site.baseurl }}/admin/loading/materialized-views.html#materialization-status[list of statuses] and corresponding actions to take.
