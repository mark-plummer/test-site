title: [Refresh a materialized view]

last_updated: 09/20/2019 summary: "You can refresh a view manually, so that its data matches the data in the underlying tables." toc: true sidebar: mydoc_sidebar permalink: /:collection/:path.html --

Materialized views can get out of sync with their underlying data.
If the status of a view is *Stale*, you must refresh the view manually to sync it with the table.

Note that until it is refreshed, the view remains searchable.

To refresh a view manually, follow these steps:

. To find your view, click *Data* in the top menu, and choose *Views*.
. Click *Schema*.
. In the *Materialization* panel, notice that the *Status* is _Stale_.
. Next to the _Stale_ status, click *Refresh Data*.
