summary: "As long as you have permissions to edit a worksheet, you can always go into it and set a different join or RLS rule." toc: false sidebar: mydoc_sidebar permalink: /:collection/:path.html --

If you find that the charts and tables built on a worksheet contain a large number of null values (which display as `+{blank}+` in the web browser), you can fix this by changing the link:mod-ws-internal-joins.html#[internal joins] for the worksheet.

If you have the *Can administer ThoughtSpot* privilege or the *Can manage data* plus edit privilege on a worksheet, you can edit the worksheet and change its RLS or other key settings.

== Change/configure a worksheet

Before working through this procedure, make sure you are familiar with how the following affect data:

* link:mod-ws-internal-joins.html#[internal worksheet joins]
* link:progressive-joins.html#[worksheet join rule]
* link:{{ site.baseurl }}/admin/data-security/set-rls.html#[row level security (RLS)]

To configure these values for a worksheet:

. Click *Data* on the top navigation bar and then on *Worksheets*.
. Click the name of the worksheet you want to edit from the list.
. Click the *Edit Worksheet* button in the upper right hand side of the screen.
. Click the *+ icon* next to *Sources*.
. Scroll to the bottom of the page.
