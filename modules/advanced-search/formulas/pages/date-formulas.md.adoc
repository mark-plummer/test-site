last_updated: tbd toc: true sidebar: mydoc_sidebar permalink: /:collection/:path.html -- Date functions are useful when you want to compare data collected between two date periods.
Date formulas allow you to apply date related functions to your formulas.

== Date formulas

The date formulas include:

{% include content/date-func.md %}

== Calculate date formulas

Calculating date formulas is useful when you want to compare data from different date periods.
Here are some examples of using date formulas:

=== Example 1

The following example shows you how to create formulas that you can use to compare data from this week to last week.

* The formula for this week is: `week ( today () ) - week (date)`
* The formula for last week is: `diff_days ( week ( today ) ) , week ( date ) )`

=== Example 2

The following example shows you how to calculate the percent increase from the last date period to this period in terms of revenue.

. Create the formula: `this week revenue = sum ( if ( this week ) then revenue else 0 )`
. Then create the formula: `last week revenue = sum ( if (last week ) then revenue else 0 )`
. Use link:{{ site.baseurl }}/complex-search/about-nested-formulas.html#[nested formulas] to calculate the percent increase by creating a parent formula: `percent increase = ( ( last week revenue - this week revenue) / last week revenue ) \* 100`

== Fiscal and Gregorian calendars

For the following date formulas, you can further specify either `fiscal` or Gregorian `calendar` on which to base date calculations.
(If you do not specify a calendar type, the formula defaults to standard Gregorian, with the year starting in January.)

* `day_number_of_quarter`
* `day_number_of_year`
* `month_number`
* `month_number_of_quarter`
* `quarter_number`
* `start_of_quarter`
* `start_of_year`
* `week_number_of_quarter`
* `week_number_of_year`
* `year`

Your ThoughtSpot administrator and ThoughtSpot Support can link:{{ site.baseurl }}/admin/setup/set-custom-calendar.html#[set up a fiscal calendar year] to start on any month.
If the `fiscal` year is not explicitly configured in the system, `fiscal` defaults to January, the same as the Gregorian `calendar`.

For example, the formula `month_number_of_quarter (05/01/2014)` would return `2` based on the default Gregorian calendar, whereas the formula `month_number_of_quarter (05/01/2014, 'fiscal')` would return `1` if your administrator has configured the fiscal calendar to start at May.
