You should also refer to the link:integrate-ADFS.html#[overview] of the entire process of integrating with AD FS.

To initialize the Service Provider metadata on AD FS:

. Open the AD FS 2.0 Management Console.
. Select *Add Relying Party Trust*.
. Select *Import data about the relying party from a file*.
. Upload the metadata.xml file that you downloaded from ThoughtSpot earlier.
. Select *Next.* The wizard may complain that some of the content of the metadata is not supported.
You can safely ignore this warning.
. In the *Ready to Add Trust* section, make sure that the tab endpoints contains multiple endpoint values.
If not, verify that your metadata was generated with the HTTPS protocol URLs.
. Leave the *Open the Edit Claim Rules dialog* checkbox checked.
Click *Next*.
. Select *Add Rule*.
. Choose *Send LDAP Attributes as Claims* and click *Next.*
. For *NameID* enter "Claim rule name"
. For *Attribute store*, choose "Active Directory".
. For *LDAP Attribute* choose "SAM-Account-Name".
. For *Outgoing claim type*, choose "Name ID".
 .. If you are using ADFS 3.0, you might need to configure the Name ID as a Pass Through claim.
. Finish the wizard and confirm the claim rules window.
. Open the provider by double-clicking it.
. Select the *Advanced* tab and change *Secure hash algorithm* to "SHA-1".
. Your Service Provider is now registered.
